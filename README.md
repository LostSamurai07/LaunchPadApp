# 🌍 LaunchPad – A Skill-First Hiring Platform for the Next Generation

LaunchPad is a global-first recruitment platform that flips the traditional resume model. We empower job seekers to showcase their actual skills — not just credentials — and help employers identify top talent based on proven capabilities, not where someone studied or who they know.

## 🚀 Why LaunchPad?

The current hiring system is broken — especially for students and recent graduates:

- 51% of "entry-level" jobs demand prior work experience.
- Recruiters struggle to assess real skills from a 1-page resume.
- Talented individuals are overlooked due to lack of connections or "brand-name" degrees.

LaunchPad provides a fair, skill-first alternative to traditional hiring — connecting capable individuals with meaningful opportunities.
