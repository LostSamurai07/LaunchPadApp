# LaunchPad: Revolutionizing Skills-First Hiring in Bangladesh

## 🚀 Project Overview

Just a year ago, the youth of Bangladesh initiated a national movement against biased recruitment practices, driven by deep frustration over youth unemployment and inequality in hiring. This inspired the creation of **LaunchPad**, Bangladesh's first skill-first hiring platform designed exclusively for internships and entry-level jobs.

LaunchPad aims to fix the gap in the traditional resume-based hiring system, where skill often doesn't get a fair chance. We are rebuilding recruitment from the ground up to serve both fresh talent and employers honestly, ensuring candidates are judged on their real-world capabilities.

## ✨ Key Features

1.  **Skill Portfolio Builder**: Users complete industry-specific challenges to build a visible, credible skill portfolio.
2.  **Skills-Based Hiring**: Employers post small tasks relevant to their jobs. Applicants apply by completing these tasks and submitting their skill portfolio, allowing direct assessment of their capabilities. Task submissions and tracking are handled by the Supabase backend.
3.  **AI-Powered Customized Roadmap**: LaunchPad's AI Roadmap engine (using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo) analyzes a student’s current skills and career targets to generate practical skill-building plans, integrated with Supabase for real-time progress tracking.

_LaunchPad provides recruiters a smarter way to find talent while allowing freshers a way to prove themselves through their skills._

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

LaunchPad was built using Bolt.new’s AI app builder.

*   **Frontend & UI/UX**: All UI prompts were tailored to reflect a retro, youth-focused Bangladeshi aesthetic using Bolt’s code generation capabilities.
*   **Backend**: Managed via Supabase, providing scalable authentication and data management for users and job posts. Supabase Edge Functions are used for OpenAI API integration.
*   **AI-integration**: OpenAI’s GPT 3.5-turbo API was used for AI-powered operations.
*   **Deployment**: Deployed using Netlify.

## 🏆 Hackathon Journey & Achievements

LaunchPad was submitted to **Netlify’s Deploy Challenge** and **Supabase’s Startup Challenge**.

### Challenges Faced

*   **Limited Access**: Difficulty upgrading to Bolt Pro due to Stripe not being supported in Bangladesh, requiring careful token management.
*   **Token Management**: Significant tokens spent on debugging Bolt-generated code.
*   **Inexperience with Building**: Time spent overcoming a lack of experience with backend and API integrations.

### Accomplishments We're Proud Of

*   Built a complete job platform from scratch using only prompts.
*   Designed a skills-first recruitment model to solve a pressing issue in Bangladesh.
*   Discovered how to provide precise, effective instructions to AI for prompting.
*   Successfully integrated the backend with Supabase and OpenAI's API.

### What We Learned

*   Prompt engineering is a skill in itself; effective instructions yield powerful results with AI.
*   Backend and AI integration are not as intimidating as they seem, especially with supportive tools and communities.
*   The recruitment space is ripe for disruption, but only if designed with empathy and inclusivity.

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

*   **University Onboarding**: Partner with university career offices to source real internship & job listings and promote student adoption.
*   **Public Launch**: Roll out LaunchPad as a real-world solution to empower freshers in the job market.
*   **Scale Beyond Bangladesh**: Expand operations to South Asia and beyond, addressing youth unemployment and recruiting bias globally.
